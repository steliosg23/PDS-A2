        "# Benchmarks - Advanced Model: PubMedBERT\n",
        "\n",
        "**PubMedBERT** is a **pretrained language model** based on BERT, specifically fine-tuned on **biomedical text** such as PubMed abstracts. This model is designed to capture the complexities of biomedical language, including specialized terminology and health-related concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of Using Pretrained PubMedBERT for Food Hazard Detection:\n",
        "- **Domain Expertise**: Being pretrained on biomedical literature, PubMedBERT already understands key terms related to **food safety**, such as **toxins**, **bacteria**, and **allergens**, which makes it highly effective for detecting and classifying food hazards.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Faster and More Efficient**: Using a pretrained model significantly reduces training time compared to building a model from scratch. It has already learned general language patterns, so fine-tuning it on food hazard data requires less data and computational power while still achieving strong performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Task-Specific Fine-Tuning**: By fine-tuning PubMedBERT on tasks like **hazard-category**, **product-category**, **hazard**, and **product** classification, it adapts to the specific requirements of food hazard detection. This enables accurate classification of food safety incidents and associated risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Task-Specific Fine-Tuning of PubMedBERT\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning PubMedBERT for food hazard detection involves adapting its pre-trained biomedical knowledge to specific classification tasks:\n",
        "- **Hazard-Category Classification**: Classifies types of hazards (e.g., microbiological, chemical).\n",
        "- **Product-Category Classification**: Identifies food product types (e.g., dairy, meat).\n",
        "- **Hazard Identification**: Detects specific hazards (e.g., Salmonella, pesticide).\n",
        "- **Product Identification**: Pinpoints exact products (e.g., milk, spinach).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Process**:\n",
        "1. Add task-specific classification heads.\n",
        "2. Fine-tune on labeled food hazard data using loss functions like cross-entropy.\n",
        "3. Optimize representations for accurate domain-specific predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits**:\n",
        "- Adapts to food safety terminology.\n",

        "### Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The `train_and_evaluate_nn` function performs **fine-tuning** of pre-trained transformer models for specific classification tasks. Fine-tuning involves adapting a pre-trained model to task-specific data to improve its performance on a given problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Fine-tuning Process\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pre-trained Model Initialization**:\n",
        "   - The function uses `AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained` to load a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, PubMedBERT).\n",
        "   - These models are pre-trained on large corpora to capture general language representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Task-specific Adjustment**:\n",
        "   - Fine-tuning modifies the model's weights using labeled datasets for specific tasks (e.g., hazard or product classification).\n",
        "   - A classification head with `num_labels` matching the task's categories is added.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Custom Data Preparation**:\n",
        "   - Text data (`title` or `text`) and labels are tokenized and loaded into `TextDataset`.\n",
        "   - DataLoaders provide batches for training and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Training**:\n",
        "   - The model is fine-tuned for several epochs using task-specific data.\n",
        "   - Loss is computed with `CrossEntropyLoss`, and weights are updated via the `Adam` optimizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Evaluation**:\n",
        "   - Predictions are decoded and evaluated using metrics like the weighted **F1-score** and classification reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Outputs\n",
        "\n",
        "- Weighted **F1-scores** for each task.\n",
        "- Detailed **classification reports** for evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Use in Food Hazard Detection:\n",
        "1. **Hazard-category**: Classifies the **type of hazard** (e.g., biological, chemical).\n",
        "2. **Product-category**: Identifies the **type of product** (e.g., meat, dairy) linked to a hazard.\n",
        "3. **Hazard**: Detects **specific foodborne hazards** such as bacteria or contamination.\n",
        "4. **Product**: Classifies the **specific product** involved in the food safety incident.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **pretrained** nature of PubMedBERT allows for more efficient adaptation to the food hazard domain, enabling faster, more accurate identification of food safety risks.\n"
